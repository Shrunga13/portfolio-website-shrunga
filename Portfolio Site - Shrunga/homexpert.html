      <div class="Information">
        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>In 2018, there were 5.96 million homes sold in the U.S, and this figure is projected to increase to 6.12 million by 2020 (according to statista.com – a US Home Sales Statistics Company). As we can see a huge increase in the number of houses being sold, we are certain that people will need more household services. Household services refer to activities such as Cleaning Services, Child-Rearing Service, Lawn Service, Home Styling Services, Home Security Services, Handyman Repair Services, and so forth.</p>
        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>During my research, I found that many people are not aware of different mobile applications or websites that provide expert household services, online advice, or in-person help. More surprisingly, quite a few people I interviewed, did not even know which services they will need once they move into a new house. In addition, people were not sure how they can trust someone's advice via text, phone call, or video call.</p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>Using a user-centered design approach, creating a product in the form of a single source technology-based tool that will help an individual learn about the services available and choose where and from whom to get those services - either online or in-person.</p>

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>The homexpert is a project I worked on while completing my UX Design course through CareerFoundry. To create this application I conducted user research and testing, developed wireframes, and task flows based on user needs and collaborated with my tutor and mentor to create an intuitive, user-friendly application.</p>

    <p>Personas are fictional characters, which you create based upon your research to represent the different user types that might use your service, product, site, or brand similarly.</p>
    <p>Creating personas will help you to understand your users' needs, experiences, behaviors, and goals.From the insights obtained from the interviews, surveys and informal observations, two unique personas have emerged.</p>

  <p>An experience map is a tool that helps us understand the experience a customer has with their product or service
Based on the findings and the personas, I created two experience maps. The first experience map shows a persona’s current journey finding an expert for her unique project and contacting them via text. The second experience map shows their journey sharing their inspiration via text with their expert.</p>

  </picture>
  <p>UX flows, or flowcharts, as they are sometimes called, are diagrams that display the complete path a user takes when using a product. The user flow lays out the user's movement through the product, mapping out each and every step the user takes—from entry point right through to the final interaction.</p>

  <p>Taking into account Sara and Mike’s goals, I created a list of content and features. I then conducted an open card sorting exercise where participants were asked to categorize and label the content as made sense to them. The data collected was key to forming the navigation system.</p>

<div class="Wireframing">
<div>
  <h2>Low Fidelity</h2>

  <p>A low-fidelity prototype is a quick and easy tangible representation of a concept, a user flow, or an information structure created for getting quick feedback and improving the product.
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Mid Fidelity</h2>

<p>Based on my initial sketches, I created a set of mid-fidelity wireframes. In doing this I was able to map out the bare-bones of the app, including some of the more subtle aspects such as element spacing/dimensions, identifying reusable patterns and setting the typographic scale.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>High Fidelity</h2>

<p> High-fidelity wireframes are highly detailed.They actually fill in the details that are missing in their low-fidelity predecessors. As such, they typically contain elements that are intended to accurately represent the final product.</p>

    </picture>
    <p>User testing refers to a technique used in the design process to evaluate a product, feature, or prototype with real users. Setting up user testing involves creating a test plan, recruiting participants, performing the test, and analyzing the results to produce findings & recommendations.</p>

    <p>A style guide is a document that a UX designer creates to document a growing and ever-evolving set of design guidelines that arise from the design process. </p>
    <p>A pattern library is a collection of user interface design elements.</p>
